# Unit Converter App

## Description

**The Unit Converter App is a simple and efficient tool built using Jetpack Compose. It allows users to convert between different units of measurement, including meters, centimeters, feet, and millimeters. The app features a clean and modern UI with both light and dark modes that adapt dynamically based on user preference.  
This app provides an immersive, edge-to-edge layout for a seamless user experience, with full-screen functionality that hides the status and navigation bars.

**Installation**

    1. Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/unit-converter-app.git`

    2. Open the project in Android Studio.
    
    3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

**Usage**

    1. Enter the value you want to convert.
    2. Select the input and output units from the dropdown menus.
    3. The app will automatically calculate and display the result.
    4. Toggle between light and dark mode using the switch button for better visibility.

**Technologies Used**

    * Jetpack Compose: Modern Android UI toolkit for building native interfaces.
    * Kotlin: Programming language used for Android development.
    * Material Design 3: For styling and layout components.

**How It Works**

The app leverages Jetpack Compose's state management system to handle user inputs and display the converted output. The unit conversion logic is built into a simple function that updates the output dynamically based on user input. Additionally, the app uses a toggle button to switch between dark and light modes, adjusting the UI theme accordingly.

**Future Enhancements**

    Add support for more units of measurement (e.g., inches, kilometers, etc.).
    Implement more categories of conversion (e.g., weight, temperature).
    Add history or recent conversions.
    Add localization for multiple languages.
